## About Me

Network engineer with a focus on **Azure, Microsoft 365, identity, and modern infrastructure**.

I build, break, and document systems so I can rebuild them better.

But this site is more than a bio, it’s a living record of my journey.

Because while my day job lives in the cloud, my real learning often starts at home, in the rack, behind the firewall, inside the lab.

## Why This Site Exists

I created this site for a simple reason:

To document my own networking journey.

Not the polished version.  
Not the highlight reel.  
The real version.

The late-night troubleshooting.  
The misconfigured VLANs.  
The broken inter-VLAN routing.  
The identity sync issues.  
The “why is this certificate invalid?” moments.  

I’ve learned that the fastest way to truly understand infrastructure is to **write about it**.  
When you document something clearly enough to teach it, you understand it differently.

This site forces me to slow down, clarify my thinking, and turn chaos into structure.

And if someone else benefits from that process? Even better.

## The Home Lab Is Where It Happens

My home network isn’t just Wi-Fi and a router.

It’s a lab environment built to mirror real-world architecture.

I run:

- **pfSense** for firewalling, VLAN segmentation, VPNs, and policy control  
- **Proxmox** for virtualization and containerized workloads  
- Segmented networks for servers, clients, IoT, and management  
- Hybrid identity integrations tied back to Microsoft cloud services  
- DNS, DHCP, and routing configured the way I would design them in production  

The goal isn’t complexity for the sake of complexity.

It’s intentional design.

I want to understand how packets move.  
How identity flows.  
How policies break connectivity.  
How misconfiguration creates vulnerability.  

The lab gives me a safe place to test ideas before they matter.

## What I Focus On

My work and learning center around:

- **Azure architecture and hybrid networking**
- **Microsoft 365 ecosystem**
- **Identity and access management**
- **Modern authentication (Entra ID, Conditional Access, Zero Trust)**
- **Network segmentation and firewall policy design**
- **Virtualization with Proxmox**
- **Automation and infrastructure-as-code fundamentals**

I’m especially interested in how identity and networking intersect, because in modern infrastructure, identity *is* the new perimeter.

Firewalls still matter.  
Routing still matters.  
But access control is increasingly policy-driven, cloud-connected, and identity-aware.

Understanding both layers is where real engineering happens.

## Build. Break. Improve.

I believe in learning by doing.

I lab everything.  
I test assumptions.  
I intentionally break configurations to see what fails, and why.

Because production doesn’t forgive theory.

Every VLAN misconfiguration teaches segmentation.  
Every firewall rule mistake teaches policy discipline.  
Every Proxmox rebuild teaches architecture planning.  
Every identity outage teaches dependency awareness.

Every lab becomes a lesson.  
Every failure becomes documentation.  
Every rebuild makes the design stronger.

That cycle, build → break → rebuild, is where growth happens.

## Who This Is For

This site is for:

- Engineers early in their networking or cloud journey  
- IT professionals moving into Azure and modern identity  
- Anyone building a home lab to level up  
- Anyone curious about pfSense, Proxmox, or network design  
- Anyone who learns best by seeing real-world examples  

If you're figuring it out as you go, you’re in the right place.

I don’t claim to know everything.  
I document what I’m learning so others can learn with me.

---

## The Long-Term Vision

My goal isn’t just to collect notes.

It’s to:

- Build a personal knowledge base  
- Share practical, real-world configurations  
- Show how home labs translate to production skills  
- Connect with other engineers  
- Track my growth over time  
- Contribute back to the community that helped me  

Infrastructure is always evolving.

So am I.

## Let’s Build Better Systems

If something here helps you, challenges you, or sparks an idea, that’s the win.

We’re all building something.

Mine just happens to be segmented networks, hardened firewalls, identity systems, and modern infrastructure, from the rack at home to the cloud.

And I’m documenting the journey as I go.
