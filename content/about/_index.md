## About Me

Network engineer with a focus on Azure, Microsoft 365, identity, and modern infrastructure.

I build, break, and document systems so I can rebuild them better.

But this site is more than a bio, it’s a living record of my journey.

## Why This Site Exists

I created this site for a simple reason:

To document my own networking journey.

Not the polished version.  
Not the highlight reel.  
The real version.

The late-night troubleshooting.  
The misconfigured VLANs.  
The identity sync issues.  
The “why is this certificate broken” moments.  

I’ve learned that the fastest way to truly understand infrastructure is to **write about it**.  
When you document something clearly enough to teach it, you understand it differently.

This site forces me to slow down, clarify my thinking, and turn chaos into structure.

## What I Focus On

My work and learning center around:

- **Azure architecture and hybrid networking**
- **Microsoft 365 ecosystem**
- **Identity and access management**
- **Modern authentication (Entra ID, Conditional Access, Zero Trust)**
- **Network design and troubleshooting**
- **Automation and infrastructure-as-code fundamentals**

I’m especially interested in how identity and networking intersect, because in modern infrastructure, identity *is* the new perimeter.

## Build. Break. Improve.

I believe in learning by doing.

I lab everything.  
I test assumptions.  
I intentionally break configurations to see what fails, and why.

Because production doesn’t forgive theory.

Every lab becomes a lesson.  
Every failure becomes documentation.  
Every rebuild makes the design stronger.

That cycle,  build → break → rebuild,  is where growth happens.

## Who This Is For

This site is for:

- Engineers early in their networking or cloud journey
- IT professionals moving into Azure and modern identity
- Anyone building a home lab to level up
- Anyone who learns best by seeing real-world examples

If you're figuring it out as you go, you’re in the right place.

I don’t claim to know everything.  
I document what I’m learning so others can learn with me.

## The Long-Term Vision

My goal isn’t just to collect notes.

It’s to:

- Build a personal knowledge base
- Share practical, real-world configurations
- Connect with other engineers
- Track my growth over time
- Contribute back to the community that helped me

Infrastructure is always evolving. So am I.

## Let’s Build Better Systems

If something here helps you, challenges you, or sparks an idea, that’s the win.

We’re all building something.

Mine just happens to be networks, identity systems, and modern infrastructure.

And I’m documenting the journey as I go.
