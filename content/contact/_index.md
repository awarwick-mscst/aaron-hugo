## Let’s Connect

If you’ve made it this far, chances are we have something in common.

Maybe you're building a home lab that started as “just a spare PC” and somehow turned into a rack.

Maybe you're tuning pfSense rules at midnight trying to figure out why VLAN 30 won’t talk to VLAN 10.

Maybe you're spinning up another Proxmox node because “this time I’ll document it properly.”

Or maybe you're deep in Azure networking and Conditional Access policies at 11:47 PM wondering why one test account refuses to cooperate.

Whatever brought you here, welcome.

## Why Reach Out?

I built this site to document my journey across:

- Home lab architecture  
- pfSense firewall design and segmentation  
- Proxmox virtualization and clustering  
- Azure networking and hybrid identity  
- Microsoft 365 and Conditional Access  
- Real-world infrastructure decisions  

But documenting in public changes something important:

It stops being just my lab.

It becomes part of the community’s shared learning.

If you want to reach out to:

- Ask a question about a home lab build  
- Compare pfSense rule structures or VLAN design  
- Talk Proxmox storage layouts (ZFS vs. LVM-thin?)  
- Discuss hybrid Azure + on-prem identity  
- Share a correction or a better approach  
- Collaborate on documentation  
- Swap lab architecture diagrams  
- Or just connect with another builder who believes in owning their infrastructure  

I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

## About the Home Lab Documentation

The home lab isn’t just a playground.

It’s where theory meets reality.

It’s where:

- Firewall rules break production (on purpose)  
- DNS decisions actually matter  
- Segmentation becomes muscle memory  
- Backups get tested, not just configured  
- You learn why documentation is more important than uptime  

You’ll see ongoing documentation around:

- pfSense configurations and rule logic  
- Proxmox VM architecture and resource planning  
- VLAN segmentation strategies  
- Static IP vs DDNS decisions  
- Secure remote access design  
- Hybrid identity integration with Azure  

This site exists to make that journey visible, including the mistakes.

Especially the mistakes.

## What You Can Expect

If you message me, you won’t get corporate marketing speak.

You’ll get:

- Honest feedback  
- Practical discussion  
- Architecture-first thinking  
- Builder-to-builder conversation  

No gatekeeping.  
No “you should already know that.”  
Just engineers learning in public.

## One More Thing

If you’re early in your journey and wondering if you’re “ready” to reach out, you are.

Nobody starts with a perfect rack.
Nobody designs perfect firewall rules on day one.
Nobody builds flawless identity architecture the first time.

We start by building.
We improve by documenting.
We grow by sharing.

So go ahead.

Let’s build better home labs.  
Let’s design smarter networks.  
Let’s own our infrastructure.
