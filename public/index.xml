&lt;p&gt;Hey there, fellow tinkerer. If you&amp;rsquo;re anything like me—a developer who&amp;rsquo;s spent too many late nights wrestling with bloated CMSes—you know the thrill of stripping things back to basics. Static sites?

This post is my raw, unfiltered log of the setup process. Think of it as a breadcrumb trail for anyone following in my footsteps. Let&amp;rsquo;s break it down, step by step, because if I&amp;rsquo;m doing this once, I might as well make it repeatable.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
